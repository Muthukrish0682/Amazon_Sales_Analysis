### Interpretation:

0.117 indicates a weak positive correlation between price and rating. This means that as the price increases, the rating tends to slightly increase as well. However, since the value is close to 0, the relationship is very weak and might not be practically significant. In other words, price does not have a strong impact on the ratings of the products in your dataset.
